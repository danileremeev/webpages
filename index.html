	My name is Danny, and I'm a <em>current</em> engineering student at NCSU. My major is mechanical engineering, and I'm in my 3rd year. 
	I chose it because I both like mechanical systems and machines, and because I have already been working for a mechanical contractor.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align: right; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; color: #6250A1;"> <!-- paragraph 2 for question 3, using in-line styling -->
	I work for a company called <strong>Environmental Air Systems</strong>, where I do both estimating and project management. 
	We do prefabrication, manufacture and installation of commercial mechanical systems <ins>all over the east coast</ins>.
	Some of our projects include Duke University Hospital, Lenovo HQ and IBM. When I graduate I plan on working in the design department on design-build projects.
